# Identification Server
### *Expected features* for Identification Server

For Behavior Driven Development (BDD) i am using Behat to write down the features and test them against the API.

To run the identifiacation server tests against examples (`public/examples`), run the following using the terminal from the project root (where the vendor folder resides)

    bin/behat features/identification

    > **Note:-** This requires the dependecies for identification server to be installed first
